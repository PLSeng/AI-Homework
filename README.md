# AI Homework Repository

This repository contains two main projects focused on different aspects of image processing and recognition:

## 1. LeNet Khmer Character Recognition

This project implements the LeNet architecture for recognizing Khmer characters. LeNet is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is effective for image classification tasks.

### Features
- Preprocessing of Khmer character images
- Training and evaluation of the LeNet model
- Accuracy and performance metrics

## 2. U-Net Image Segmentation

This project utilizes the U-Net architecture for image segmentation tasks. U-Net is a type of CNN designed for biomedical image segmentation but can be applied to other segmentation tasks as well.

### Features
- Preprocessing of images for segmentation
- Training and evaluation of the U-Net model
- Segmentation performance metrics
